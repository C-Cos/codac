Final group project
Three weeks to practice Sprint, Sprint Review and project management with another team; the "client".


We decided to create the project "Sport E-vent" using MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Reqct, Node).
We had to create an interface where the client could see sport events near him, connect to an account to create an event, comment on an event, subsribe to an event.

Visual were vrey important for the client so we capitalized a lot on that. Also, the geolocalisation was one of the main feature so we spent quite a time on that.
